## Deepen your understanding

**Our number one recommendation is to read the book ["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.**

Also, statistical tasks such as model fitting, hypothesis testing, confidence interval calculation, and prediction are a large part of R, and one we haven't demonstrated fully today. Linear models, and the linear model formula syntax `~`, are core to much of what R has to offer statistically. Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) for differential gene expression, `glm` for logistic regression (etc), survival analysis with `coxph`, and mixed models to characterize variation within populations.

* "Statistical Models in S" by J.M. Chambers and T.J. Hastie is the primary reference for this, although there are some small differences between R and its predecessor S.

* ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani can be seen as further development of the ideas in "Statistical Models in S", and is available online. It has more of a machine learning than a statistics flavour to it (the distinction is fuzzy!).

* "Modern Applied Statistics with S" by W.N. Venable and B.D. Ripley is a well respected reference covering R and S. 

* "Linear Models with R" and "Extending the Linear Model with R" by [J. Faraway](http://www.maths.bath.ac.uk/~jjf23/) cover linear models, with many practical examples.



## Expand your vocabulary

Have a look at these cheat sheets to see what is possible with R.

* [RStudio's collection of cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) cover newer packages in R.
* [An old-school cheat sheet](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) for dinosaurs and people wishing to go deeper.
* [A Bioconductor cheat sheet](https://github.com/mikelove/bioc-refcard/blob/master/README.Rmd) for biological data.

[The R Manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) are the place to look if you need a precise definition of how R behaves.

## Join the community

Join the [Data Fluency community at Monash](https://www.monash.edu/data-fluency).

 * Mailing list for workshop and event announcements.
 * Slack for discussion.
 * Monthly seminars on Data Science topics.
 * Drop-in sessions on Friday afternoon.

Meetups in Melbourne:

* [MelbURN](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/MelbURN-Melbourne-Users-of-R-Network/)
* [R-Ladies](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/R-Ladies-Melbourne/)

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) run intensive two day workshops on scientific computing and data science topics worldwide. The style of this present workshop is very much based on theirs. For bioinformatics, [COMBINE](https://combine.org.au/) is an Australian student and early career researcher organization, and runs Carpentries workshops and similar.
