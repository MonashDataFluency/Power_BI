# Saving and Exporting

Now that we have visualised the data and created various types of plots we need to save our visuals. 

## Saving as pbix files

Go to **File > Save**, then choose an appropriate file name and the folder to save it. Click on **Save**.

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/save.png")
```

The file extension for Power BI files is “.pbix”. The .pbix files are highly compressed file types that contains all the graphics along with the actual data.

*Note: If you share your .pbix file with others, your actual data gets shared as well.*

## Exporting and publishing report

Now we want to create a report of our analysis and share it with others. We use Power BI to publish the report on the Power BI server.

To do this, go to **File > Publish > Publish to Power BI**.

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/publish1.png")
```

After clicking on **Publish to Power BI**, you will be prompted to select a destination on the Power BI server where you want to publish your report. The default setting is **My workspace**. You can create different workspaces dedicated to different projects on the server. Let’s use the default option, and click **Select**.

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/publish2.png")
```

It takes about 2-3 mins to finalise the report and you will see the following success message on your screen.

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/publish3.png")
```

Congratulations! The report has been published to your workspace on PowerBI. To access it, click on **Open <YOUR_FILENAME.pbix>** in Power BI.


```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/open_in_server.png")
```

After you click on the link, you will be taken to Power BI’s login through Microsoft. You need to fill in your login credentials. 

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/login_server.png")
```

Once you sign in, you will see the Power BI dashboard. Scroll through the tabs on the top - Dashboards, Reports, Workbooks and Datasets. We are interested in the **Reports** tab because that is where you can find your published report. The different types of actions can be seen under the **Actions** tab. These actions include - share, analyze in Excel, quick insights etc. Hover over the different symbols to find out what they do and select the appropriate action.

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/powerbi_dashboard.png")
```

We want to take a look at our report and share it with others. Let’s click on the report itself. You will see a similar screen showing your report:

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/report.png")
```

If you click on **Edit** on the top, you will be able to edit mode and perform nearly everything you can in the Power BI desktop. 

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/edit_report.png")
```

You can see all the Visualization options and fields in the Power BI server. Click on the **Share** button in the top left corner. This allows you to share your report with others. 

```{r echo=F,out.width="100%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ch05/powerbi_desktop_options.png")
```

<!--## What's next?

We will also have an intermediate level workshop on Power BI, which is about establishing relational connections between different datasets.-->
