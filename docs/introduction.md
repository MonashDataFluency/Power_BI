These are course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by the [Monash Bioinformatics Platform](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/bioinformatics) for the [Monash Data Fluency](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/) initiative. Our teaching style is based on the style of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). This is a new version of the course focussing on the modern [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages. We believe this is currently the quickest route to being productive in R.

* [ZIP of data files used in this workshop](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-intro-2/r-intro-2-files.zip)

During the workshop we will be using the RStudio Cloud to use R over the web:

* [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

You can also install R on your own computer. There are two things to download and install:

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R, either on your local computer or on a server.
